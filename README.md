The odin-recipes put all the Command Line,Git and Github, and HTML knowledge I have acquired thus far in my Odin Project Pre-Course Work. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
Here I am going to demonstrate my skills in using the command line to create, edit, and navigate through files and folders.
I am then going to create a repository in my GitHub and then clone the repository onto my local machine.
Finally, I am going to demostrate HTML skills learned to build a basic recipe website and push my work to github.
